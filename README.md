## Dependencies

# For Developers of this mod
## Install
We have a build system to allow for key signing and addon compiling.

### Requirements
1. [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
1. Windows PowerShell v5.1 or higher

<ins>Automated Process:</ins>

To automatically set up your system and build the mod you can execute the included `build.bat` file.
You can do this by either going to `\tools` and double clicking the `build.bat` file, or if you use VSC you can select the bat file then in the `TERMINAL` at the bottom you can select the `Run Active File` option from the `...` menu.

<ins>Manual Proccess:</ins>

To set up your system to use the build script:
- Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator and execute `set-executionpolicy remotesigned`
- In the future, always use PowerShell as Admin

### Windows
If on Windows, use the `tools\make.ps1` file to build the mod for you. It will build the mod, sign the addons, include the public key in the `keys` folder, and also copy across all files found in the `extras` folder, as well as the files specified in the file `tools\support-files.txt`.

The build script will NOT leave the private key in the `keys` folder. It will delete it instead, to avoid any accidental uploading or distribution.

Be aware, that the names of the `.bisign` and `.bikey` files depend on the latest tag on git. This means that, if you wish to upload a release, it is advised to first tag the latest git commit, and then build the mod. That way you have a nice version, such as `VS_C_v1.0.0.bikey` rather than `VS_C_-gae17a97.bikey`.

## Naming conventions
For standardisation between class names and to prevent any possible future conflicts with class names the following naming convention has been developed:
- for code: VS_Core
- for presentation: Viking Studios - {Addon Name}
